About :

This game is programmed for TI-89 and TI-92+.
You must scroll trough the level, jumping on the floor
on a 3D road.
This is like the game called PlainJump on the other
TI calculators, or Babal on HP calculators.

It has been written fully in C language, it's my FIRST
C program.

It is compiled in NOSTUB.
No kernel or external libraries is required.
