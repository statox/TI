This is a BETA verison.  Its not yet complete.  Neither is the tutorial.
If you're not satisfied and aren't able to program becasue of this,
then I apploigize.  You'll definately need to know some BASIC in order
to better understand the language.  They share similar syntax.

Another thing, becasue the project is still in development, it is
absolutely possible that some syntax could change from one version to
the next.  I'm trying my hardest to make sure this does not happen.

A third thing, I can't stress this enough.  You NEED to make backups
and archive your stuff before using the parser, esspecially your source
code.  I can almost garentee that you will get several accidental RAM
clears from your code and I can't be held liable for your loss of data.

Not to discourage anyone though, it really is a fun tool :)
