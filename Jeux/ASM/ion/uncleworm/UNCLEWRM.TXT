How to Run
==========
Uncle Worm requires Ion to run.

To run Uncle Worm, make sure Ion is installed on your calculator. Send either
UNCLEWRM.83P or UNCLEWRM.8XP (for the 83 and 83+ respectively) to your
calculator and start Ion. Now you can run Uncle Worm.


About
=====
Uncle Worm is a snake-type game with a difference. Unlike Nibbles, where you
can travel in four directions only, Uncle Worm can travel in no less than
thirty-two directions.


How to Play
===========
At the title screen, use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to select the game speed,
then press 2ND. Select the slow speed to start with. A different high score is
recorded for each game speed.

Next, you will see Uncle Worm travelling upward from the bottom of the screen.
If he hits the edge of the screen, he'll die and the game will be over. So
before he hits the top, steer him out of trouble using the LEFT and RIGHT
arrow keys. Uncle Worm will also die if he crashes into himself, but right now
he's too short for that to happen. The longer you hold down LEFT or RIGHT, the
more Uncle Worm will turn.

Somewhere on the screen there will be an apple (a black circle). Steer Uncle
Worm into this apple and he'll eat it. Another apple will appear somewhere
else, and Uncle Worm will grow in length. The bigger the apple, the more he'll
grow.

After eating ten apples, a gap will appear at the top of the screen. You must
guide Uncle Worm through this gap to complete the level. On the next level the
playing area will be smaller.


Scoring
=======
Eat apple  4 to 8 points
           (dependent on size)

Win level  16 points for level 1
           32 points for level 2
           48 points for level 3
           ...etc...

  Uncle Worm's head

  appear in the worm
