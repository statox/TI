                                       I.   BUGS:

	No bugs have been found, those that were have been taken care of. 
	If you find a bug drop me a line. E:mail at bottom. 
	This is a minor bug, after pressing MATH, the Mode button no longer shows your score.
	This doesn't really affect the game at all, except you can't see your score anymore.
	That error only occurs in ION, the game works great in Mirage.

				      IV.   VERSION HISTORY

	Acid 2.0:
        ---------
	First public release, last final release.
	One minor glitch no big whoop.
	Game is only 861 bytes. 
	Very graphical, nice mode feature, a cool title pic.
	

	Acid v1.0:
	----------
	Not really ready for public yet, needs one more updated version.
	Speed glitches, pipe glitches, guy glitches, needs a ton of work.
	Thinking of putting in a title pic, maybe.
