About this Program:
	This is the level editor for Super Mario ION. It will allow you to create and
edit levelsets for that game. I hope that you find this program useful.

Controls:
MODE   = Menu
2nd    = Place Block
Alpha  = Select Block from Table
DEL    = Remove Block
Y=     = Place Enemy
WINDOW = Previous Block
ZOOM   = Next Block
TRACE  = Shift Left 8 blocks (for easy shifting)
GRAPH  = Shift Right 8 blocks (for easy shifting)
XTO    = Insert Column
STAT   = Remove Column
+/-    = Change Level
CLEAR  = Exit

Add/Remove Level is located in the Menu.

To end a level, place a end bar as an enemy.

Limitations:
There are some limitations inherent to the game...
	1)You may only place 1 enemy per column (this ensure that there won't be too many
		enemies on the screen)
	2)Levels can be at most 128 in width
	3)You can only ADD and REMOVE levels from the end of your levelset
