Program:	Super Mario v1.2
Author:		Sam Heald (evil_sam@hotmail.com)
Graphics:       Bill Nagel
Version:	1.2
System:		TI-83 (+) ION (or MirageOS)
Released:	06-28-01

I. Description/Objective:
	For those of you who have lived in a hole for the past decade or so, Mario has been
and will always be the official mascot of Nintendo. He has appeared in countless titles over
the years in genres ranging from RPGs, Puzzle, Party, Racing, and Education. However, Mario
will forever be a platform character. Starting on the original NES, Mario has evolved as a
platform character across the Gameboy, SNES, Nintendo 64, and most recently the Gameboy
Advance. His look has changed along the way, shifting from 2-D to 3-D, and he has gained
some friends and family helpers along the way (Yoshi, Luigi, Toad, etc.). However, the 
enjoyable premise of all these games has been the same. Mario runs through levels, collecting
coins, stomping goombas, striving to reach his final destination. Mario has never been a
game about high scores or a deep storyline, just good ol' family fun.
	This TI rendition of Mario remains true to the original roots: Fast 2-D scrolling
gameplay with all the coins, enemies, and fun. The graphics and general concepts have been
recreated from Bill Nagel's Mario 86. When Bill first released Mario 86, I was thoroughly
impressed by it. Still somewhat of a novice z80 programmer, I asked him if I could port it
to my trusty TI-82. He told me that Mario was too advanced a game, I was too inferior a
programmer, and if it would be done at all, it would be done by him. Well, it was never
done by him. 
	I hope you enjoy my rendition of Mario. Nagel's graphics have been recreated as well
has the external level "Nagel.82p", but absolutely no program code has been shared between
the two programs. My version adds the use of fireballs, as well as not having some of the bugs
that his had (255 coin, dungeon fire, etc.).This program utilizes external levels (one by
Bill Nagel) is included.. A full-featured level editor with password protection is also
included. Information on how to use the editor is located in medit.txt.
